Hello World
================
Last update: 2022-12-09

## What is this?

This is a GitHub Flavored Markdown converted from an R Markdown, which
can embed R code chunks within the document. Just a simple code testing:

``` r
print("Hello World!")
```

    ## [1] "Hello World!"

## What will I share here?

I collect social media data from Twitter, Reddit, YouTube, etc. and I
will share things related to data science and computational analysis
here :-)

The first one is [my quick tweet analysis for ASCILITE 2022
conference](https://cocolaberica.github.io/ascilite22.html).
