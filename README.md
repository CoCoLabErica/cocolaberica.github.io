Hello World
================
Last update: 2022-12-11

## What is this?

This is a prototype (first version) of my knowledge website or technical
blog for organising and sharing knowledge about technology, education
and research.

## What will I share here?

### My computational methods and data science approach

I collect social media data from Twitter, Reddit, YouTube, etc. and I
will share things related to data science and computational analysis
here :-)

The first one is [my quick tweet analysis for ASCILITE 2022
conference](https://cocolaberica.github.io/ascilite22.html).

I also plan to share my notes on R programming, how to run Python
scripts in the
<a href="https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/" target="_blank">R
Studio IDE</a>, how to setup Git and GitHub, etc.

### Non-technical resources for teachers and researchers

I like to find and test interesting things that can be embedded and
shown in a webpage for teaching and learning, such as online 3D models
viewers, useful HTML & CSS effects, and online code editors.

The key is these ideas and resources do not require any coding skills
(just copy-and-paste the given HTML code to embed and show the objects
in a website or LMS).
<a href="https://sites.google.com/view/cocolaberica"
target="_blank">Here is my playground</a> for quick testing and
demonstration.

## How did I create this?

This is a GitHub Flavored Markdown (a ReadMe file) converted from an R
Markdown, which can embed R code chunks within the document. Just a
simple code testing:

``` r
print("Hello World!")
```

    ## [1] "Hello World!"

Showing code chunks will enable me to share how to do coding stuff when
I talk about technical things.

I knit my R Markdown with `output: github_document` in the YAML header
and then push this to [my github.io public
repository](https://github.com/CoCoLabErica/cocolaberica.github.io) -
free and easy. Visit
<a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a> to
learn how to host a webpage or blog on GitHub. And I will give a more
detailed explanation later.
